Script that generates names and email addresses of virtual portuguese people and votes automatically for an artistâ€™s work at a shopping mall online contest. We noticed that the other contestants were forging votes and so we played the game.
We got second place. Originally 3rd place, but the artist at 1st place was disqualified, for faking votes. I guess our script went under the radar.
