Script that generates names and email addresses of virtual portuguese people and votes automatically for an artistâ€™s work at a shopping mall online contest. We noticed that the other contestants were forging votes and so we played the game.
We got second place. Originally third place, but the artist at first place was disqualified, for faking votes.
